# BasicBankingSystem
The provided Java project is a simple command-line-based banking system. It includes functionalities for managing accounts, performing banking operations, and storing data temporarily. Here's an overview:

### Project Components:

1. **Classes:**
    - `MainLogic`: This class is the heart of the banking system. It handles user interactions, displays the menu, and orchestrates various operations based on user input.
    - `Account`: Represents a bank account, holding information such as the account holder's name, balance, and PIN (Personal Identification Number).
    - `DataBase`: Manages a collection of `Account` objects and handles operations related to account management, such as adding, retrieving, and showing account details.

2. **Functionality:**
    - **Menu Display and User Input:**
        - The `MainLogic` class is responsible for displaying a welcome message and a menu with different options.
        - It uses a `Scanner` to receive user input for various operations.

    - **Account Operations:**
        - Viewing balance: Users can check the balance by providing their username and PIN.
        - Deposit and Withdraw: Users can deposit or withdraw funds by providing their username, PIN, and the amount.
        - Create new account: Users can create a new account by entering a username and PIN.
        - Show Accounts: Displays all existing accounts in the database.

    - **Validation and Error Handling:**
        - The system validates the input and checks for the existence of accounts before executing operations like viewing balance, depositing, or withdrawing funds.
        - It verifies the entered PIN against the stored PIN for authentication.

    - **Exit Functionality:**
        - Users can exit the application by selecting the exit option in the menu.

This project provides a foundation for a simple banking system, but additional improvements could be made to refine its functionalities and security measures.
